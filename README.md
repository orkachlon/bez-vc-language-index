# Semitic Language Index
An interactive index of the Semitic languages.<br>
Created as part of Informative Design course at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design.

## Description
This project is a proof of concept for an interactive index of languages.<br>
In this project I indexed the Semitic languages in an interactive ancestry tree, including various information found online for each language.
The intention was to check what benefits can the third dimention and interactivity give us in an index which could otherwise be a spreadsheet. 

## Installation
1. Download version from [Releases](https://github.com/orkachlon/bez-vc-language-index/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Launch the executable.

## Instructions
* Click and drag the mouse to rotate the tree.
* Click on a language to learn more about it.
* Click on connections to traverse the tree.

## Implementation notes
- Data was gathered by hand by me.
- All of the data is read from a JSON on initialization.
- All animations are done using coroutines.
